In resevoirpy all data is stored in the format (timesteps, features). The reservoir is a pool of artificial rate neurons randomly connected to their inputs and to themselves. Therefore, they are a genuine recurrent neural network similar to those which can be found in the field of machine learning in general. However, none of the connections inside the reservoir are trained. They are randomly initialized following several hyperparameters.
